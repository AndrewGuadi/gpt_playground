Accent: #FFA500 (bright orange)
Notes: Avoid red and dark green to maintain brand consistency and avoid emergency/error color conflicts.

9. App Structure

Description:
The website is structured as a single-page responsive application with nested route support for deep linking. Core modules include: Home, Services, Booking Form, Testimonials, Blog, and Contact. A global state manages form data and user interactions; analytics events are dispatched on key CTAs.

10. Optimal Structure

Description:
Adopt a header–main–footer HTML5 semantic layout. Keep global navigation at the top, with in-page anchor links for service sections. Main content is modular and reusable (React/Vue components or server-rendered partials). Footer contains secondary navigation and legal info. Ensure HTML is accessible (ARIA landmarks) and optimized for performance (lazy-loading images, minified assets).
