Authentication:
- Public endpoints (services, reviews, emergency-contact) require no auth.
- Protected endpoints (service-request, contact) use a simple API key or reCAPTCHA for spam control.
- Admin/dashboard endpoints (not public) secured via OAuth2 bearer tokens or JWT, scoped to roles (Office Manager, Technicians).

  • 60 requests per minute per IP
  • Burst up to 100 requests
- Authenticated/Admin API:
  • 100 requests per minute per user token
  • 1,000 requests per hour
- Exceeding limits returns HTTP 429 Too Many Requests with Retry-After header.


Versioning:
- All endpoints are prefixed with /api/v1/ to allow backward-incompatible changes in future.
- Version increments follow semantic versioning:
  • v1.0.0 initial public release
  • v1.1.0 minor additions (new endpoints)
  • v2.0.0 major overhaul (breaking changes)
- Clients should specify Accept header with version (e.g., application/vnd.ccps.v1+json) if needed.
