📌 Project Concept
“Motion Beats – Tilt-to-DJ”

🎯 What It Is
A single-page, mobile-first web studio that lets anyone craft a 60-second loop of electronic music just by moving their phone.
No buttons, no menus—your wrist is the mixer.

🧩 Core Mechanics
Sensor	How it’s used	Effect in the studio
Accelerometer	Gentle tilt forward / back	Cross-fade between two drum patterns (chill → energetic)
Accelerometer	Tilt left / right	Adjust global filter (mellow → bright)
Gyroscope	Slow clockwise twist	Bring a bass-line layer in (volume 0 → 100 %)
Gyroscope	Slow counter-clockwise twist	Bring a synth-pad layer in
Quick Shake	One-shot FX burst	Adds a randomized percussion fill
DeviceOrientation (fallback)	If gyro unsupported	Same layer-in/out via device heading

⭐ Everything is smooth-faded so the loop never breaks time.
⭐ All audio is generated in-browser via the Web Audio API; nothing external is loaded.

⏳ Keeping Users Engaged ≥ 5 Minutes
Interactive Tutorial (≈ 1 min)

Animated overlay shows each motion & resultant sound.

User copies the move; visual confirm pops (“Nice filter sweep!”).

Layer-Building Phase (≈ 2 min)

Loop starts as a bare kick drum.

Prompts appear (“Tilt right to brighten the beat…”) until all four layers unlocked.

Performance Phase (open-ended)

UI hides; full-screen pulse synched to BPM.

Users jam: tilting, twisting, shaking to sculpt their personal groove.

A countdown in corner invites them to record a 30-second “set”; auto-replays it when done.

Most people play a few takes—easily 3-6 minutes total.

Share-or-Save (optional, still offline)

Generates a tiny Base64 WAV blob; “Download your loop” button (no server).

Encourages re-tries to improve mix.

🖼️ Look & Feel
index.html – header, minimal prompt area, hidden hint overlay, visualizer canvas.

styles.css – dark “club” theme, neon accent colors, fluid 100 vh layout.

script.js –

Sensor permission + polyfills

Web Audio graph (4 sampler nodes + master filter)

Motion → parameter mapping at 60 fps

Tutorial state-machine & simple recorder

No images, no libraries; just ~200 lines of JS.

⚙️ Why It Works
Immediate reward loop: every tiny wrist move changes the sound.

Creative ownership: users leave with a personalized track.

Sensor novelty: feels like waving a mini theremin/DJ controller.

Single page, offline: loads fast, plays anywhere—perfect demo piece.
